# Attentive Fusion: A Transformer-based Approach to Multimodal Hate Speech Detection
[[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10653)


Attentive Fusion is a layer designed to Fuse the output of Multimodal Data for Classification. The layer itself learns from the input data and provides useful information. It can be used beside Multi-Head Attention as it has less computation cost.
